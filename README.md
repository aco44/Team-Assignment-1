# Team-Assignment-1
This is repository to store starter project for Team Assignment 1


## Objective
### Demonstrate the following:

1. Usage of Eclipse
2. Variable Assignment
3. Looping (for, while etc)
4. Arrays (single/multi-dimension)
5. String Arrays
6. String to Integer or vice-versa conversions as needed
7. Sorting Techniques (bubble-sort)
8. User Input/Output
9. Use Github for Team collaboration and feedback

### Instructions
* You will create a basic java program to rank students based on the points they scored in the test. 
* The program should request the number of students to rank.
* Ask for each Student Name and Points scored. Display each "Student Name:Points" as soon you enter the information for a student
* When the program is done receiving information for all the students, Display information in the order it received from the user for every Student.
* Calculate the Grade based on the score scale 90-100 A, 80-89 B, 70-79 C, 60-69 D, 50-59 E, Below 49 F
* Now sort the students with highest points on top (Descending order) 
* Print the data with Rank order as top to bottom including their Grade
* Gracefully exit the program


## Sample Output

```WELCOME TO THE STUDENT RANKING APPLICATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter Number of Students you want to rank:
3
Enter Student Name:
John
Enter Student Points:
78
Student Name:Points
John:78
Enter Student Name:
Robert
Enter Student Points:
86
Student Name:Points
Robert:86
Enter Student Name:
Smith
Enter Student Points:
55
Student Name:Points
Smith:55


Before Ranking:
Student Name:Points:Grade
John:78:C
Robert:86:B
Smith:55:E

After Ranking:
Rank:Student Name:Points:Grade
1:Robert:86:B
2:John:78:C
3:Smith:55:E
```

## Required learning below to successfully complete the assignment:

* Scanner (java.util.scanner)
* Arrays (java.util.Arrays)
* Conditionals & Loops (for, while etc)
* String Operations, Int to String and vice versa conversations
* Hold multi-dimensional data (String Arrays etc.)
* Use of Variables
* Integer Sorting Techniques
